\resentry{Volunteer Web Developer for MMATHS Project}{Fall 2014-Present}
\resbody{A friend and I wrote a web app using Ruby on Rails to allow other volunteers to
submit problems for the MMATHS competition. Among other things, I used the MathJax library to
show problem previews for
problems written in \LaTeX, and created a page to edit and preview tests.}
\resentry{Junior Counselor and Counselor at Ross Mathematics Program}{Summer 2014, 15}
\resbody{I attended the program in Summer 2013. As a top student,
I was asked to return as a junior counselor. I guided the first years and graded their sets, while
finishing the sets from my first year. In 2015, I returned as a full counselor to continue
to help high schoolers discover abstract
mathematics.}
\resentry{Volunteer at the Laboratory of Neurocognitive Development (LNCD)}{Spring 2014}
\resbody{I volunteered for two weeks (60\raise.4ex\hbox{\smaller{+}} hours) at the LNCD at
the University of Pittsburgh for my senior project. I worked on the database interface for the lab's subject
information (which was written with Mojolicious, Bootstrap, and AngularJS), a working memory task for a 
study written in MATLAB, as well as numerous smaller projects involving bash scripting and 
data visualization with the aid of R.}
